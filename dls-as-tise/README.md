## How to locally preview and render the book and slides
For course development, you can preview and render the book and slides locally using Quarto. For production use and deployment, it is recommended to use the CI/CD pipeline provided in this repository. 

#### Install Quarto
Follow the instructions at [https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) to install Quarto on your system.

#### Live preview of a single slide set
```
quarto preview Week1/slides.md
```

#### Live preview of the book
```
quarto preview --profile book
```

#### Generate book and slides locally
```
quarto render --profile book
```
The files will be generated in the `_book` directory. You can then open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the book.
The slides will be generated in the `_slides` folder.

Additionally a PDF of the book will be generated. 

GitHub Actions will automatically also generate a PDF version of the slides.
